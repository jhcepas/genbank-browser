This directory (/g/bork/huerta/ct_browser/) contains all necessary scripts and
data to start a genome browser instance for the CT genome.

The framework has three components:

- ctbrowser/ : genome browser HTML application. All based on js code that runs
  in the client and calls web-services (WS) to fetch genome data. This is the
  only folder that needs to be accesible from the webserver.

- ctbrowser_daemon.py: a little python script that reads all genebank information
  and serves data as a web service. The script starts a minimal web server that
  should be started listining on a different port than apache, ie. 9000.
  
  Daemon accepts the following options: start|stop|status
  
  Daemon needs to be UP to let the web genome viewer to work, because it
  provides all data from the indexed cache. 

  The daemon script is also meant to refresh genome data and indexes. To proceed
  with and upgrade, you should make your modification in the pertinent data/*
  source files, and start the daemon with the --refresh flag.

  This will produce a full scan of the source files and an upgrade of all
  databases and data sources (genome annotations, search index terms, and blast
  DB included).

- sphinx/: search engine providing searching functionality to the genome
  browser. It uses the sphinx system to index all information, and it requires
  the searchd deamon to be running. However, this should be transparent, as the
  stop/start and upgrading options are all managed by the start_server.py
  script. 

  Note that this application may need to be recompiled if it is planned to be
  executed in a different machine:
      cd sphinx
      ./configure --without-mysql 
      ./make

  Once binaries are available under sphinx/src/, the ctbrowser_daemon.py script
  will handle the updates, starting and stopping sphinx services.
