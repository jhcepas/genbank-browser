This directory contains all necessary scripts and data to start a genome browser
instance for the CT genome.

The framework has three components:

- ctbrowser/ : genome browser HTML application. Is all based on js code that runs in the
  client and calls web-services (WS) to fetch genome data.

- start_server.py: a little python script that reads all genebank information
  and serves data as a web service. The script starts a minimal web server that
  should be started listining on a different port than apache, ie. 9000.
  
  If the script is call without arguments, cached data is used. If changes are
  present in the GBF, fasta or annotation files, the --refresh option should be
  passed. This will produce a full scan of the files and an upgrade of all
  databases and data sources (search engine and blast DB included). 

- sphinx/: search engine providing searching functionality to the genome
  browser. It uses the sphinx system to index all information, and it requires
  the searchd deamon to be running. However, this should be transparent, as the
  stop/start and upgrading options are all managed by the start_server.py
  script. 

  Note that this application may need to be recompiled if it is planned to be
  executed in a different machine:
      cd sphinx
      ./configure --without-mysql 
      ./make
