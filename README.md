Overview 
============

Genbank Browser is a tool for graphic exploration of genbank files. 

It can automatically read a generic genbank file and expose its content as a web-based genome browser, in which tracks and annotation are automatically handled. Features and their annotations are automatically indexed.

This software is written on top of BioPython, Sphinx, and Genome Viewer tools.
